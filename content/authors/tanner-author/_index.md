## About Me

Hi, I’m Tanner and this is my little spot on the internet. I intend to use it to outline some of the projects I have done along with some bits of knowledge I feel is worthy of sharing. 

If you are interested in contacting me please do so by <a href="mailto:hello@tannerembry.com">email</a>, otherwise feel free to browse some of my posts below.
